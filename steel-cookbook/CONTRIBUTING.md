# Contributing to Steel Cookbook

Welcome, AI Builder! The Steel Cookbook is a community-driven resource aimed at sharing practical examples for building web automations with Steel. Our goal is to help AI engineers build better, more reliable web agents.

## What Makes a Good Example?

The best examples in our cookbook are:

**Useful**: Demonstrates solutions to common challenges that AI engineers face when building web agents. If you're solving it repeatedly, others probably are too.

**Novel**: Shows new techniques or creative ways to use Steel's capabilities. This could be handling complex web interactions, managing sessions efficiently, or solving tricky automation scenarios.

**Well-Structured**: Provides clear, practical guidance that others can follow and adapt to their needs.
